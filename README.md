## DaRk_dOg's dotfiles
Linux eye candy

So this is a small line-up of my Ubuntu/openbox 16.04 minimal installation. Most of it is reworked files of other people, modded to suit my needs and help me build a light-weight system.

### Setup:
* openbox
* polybar
* ranger
* urxvt (with neofetch)
* ncmpcpp
* oblogout
* dunst
* skippy-xd
* i3lock
